Task View is much more than a task manager. In one service we will combine the best
techniques for organizing time and workflow. Express tasks, an automated calendar,
the “pomodoro” technique, analytics, teamwork and tracking progress are just a small
part of the functionality that the service will have.

I do not make a to-do list application. We make a service which main purpose is to achieve your goals.
